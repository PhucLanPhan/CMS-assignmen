  <h2>Local Environments</h2>
  <p>Brief description of local environments used by team members</p>
  <p>A common web development environment called XAMPP and MAMP enabled us, programmers to install a local web
     server on our personal computers. The XAMPP package is a comprehensive tool for creating dynamic
      web applications because it comes with the Apache web server, MariaDB database, PHP, FileZilla and Perl.
    The team members utilised XAMPP to set up a local development environment on our personal 
    computers for a website for student housing. We first go downloaded, and install the XAMPP software.
     After installation, we set up the jcubhomefinder database and Apache web server.
     WordPress needs Apache, MySQL, and PHP, all of which are included with XAMPP. extracted 
     the contents from the most recent WordPress installation from WordPress.org into a folder 
     in the XAMPP "htdocs" folder. This folder can be found in the XAMPP installation directory, 
     which is commonly "/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs" on a Mac or "C:xampphtdocs" on Windows. I launched a browser
      and went to "localhost/phpmyadmin." For your WordPress website, create a new database. Write down the 
      database name (jcubhomefinder), username, and password for future use. Use your web browser to go to 
      "localhost/wordpress" in the XAMPP "htdocs" folder to access the WordPress folder. Follow the installation 
      wizard's instructions and enter the database's name, username, and password.Once the installation was complete,
    we customized our WordPress site and added themes, plugins, and content as needed To ensure that every menber provide 
    sometheing we would exchange the database files and have every meber contribute something. To upload the website files 
      to the live server they would utilised FTP  file transfer software.
     In sumarry, XAMPP was integrated with WordPress by providing a local development environment for WordPress. 
     XAMPP included the necessary components to run WordPress, and WordPress was installed and customized
    in the XAMPP "htdocs" folder. This allowed us to create and test WordPress sites locally before deploying 
    them to a live server.
