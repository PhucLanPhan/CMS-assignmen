# Project Management
To facilitate our communication and task management, we have used Slack Channel, GitHub repository and Trello board.

* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PhucLanPhan/CMS-assignmen.git)<br/>
It was used to collaboratively work on the project and to keep track of the changes made by everyone to the project files.
* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/HfPsk2c6/cms)<br/>
It was used to ideate, plan, and manage the team work together in a collaborative, productive, and organized way.
* [Slack Channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T1HPNSNKT/C04QJQUABR6/thread/C04QJQUABR6-1682243806.851439)<br/>
We integrated the GitHub repository and Trello board with the Slack channel to get automatic notifications and updates in the Slack channel from the changes published in Trello board and GitHub repository so that every team member could see what everyone else in the team was working on.
