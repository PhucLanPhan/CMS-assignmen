# Deployment

The following is how development is recommended for this project

1. Download and install <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/">XAMPP</a> or <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/mamp/mac/">MAMP</a>

2. Create a local environment database server in the link localhost/phpmyadmin, then create a database sql on the name of the website. Import the database into the database that just been created, the current sql of the website should be under the name 'jcubhomefinder.sql' in  <a href="https://github.com/PhucLanPhan/CMS-assignmen.git">GitHub repository.</a>

3. Since Github won't let us to upload a large size file, we uploaded it to Google Drive. This is the full entire site <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yTMgs9IGKYnFOw9PI_X0WhrwUsZXlija/view?usp=share_link">Click here</a> . 

4. Clone or download the folder from <a href="https://github.com/PhucLanPhan/CMS-assignmen.git">GitHub</a>  repository called 'jcub-home-finder' onto your desktop and unzip the folder if you downloaded it. This is the child theme for the entire  site

5. To develop features or edit/update existing features create a new branch in the repository, appropriately named by user for version control. Note new developments, edits, and updates should be lodged on the Trello board, names for branches taken from theses card names. The Trello board effectively project manages and keeps a historical record of the project.

6. In relevant IDE customise the theme, making relevant version control commits, then push completed work to repository. Create relevant pull requests to main branch. Pull requests must be tested before merging to main branch.

7. Once the main branch is merged and updated with the changes, the repository can be pulled to local environment so as to be uploaded via zip file into the staging site via appearance/theme/add new, then activated to test in the staging website. After testing on the staging website is successful, the theme zip folder can be uploaded to the production site.


# Web Hosting
We use this web hosting provider called <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> because it offers the following  
* Unlimited Websites
* Add Domains Easily
* Unlimited Traffic
* Unmetered Bandwidth
* 30GB SSD Storage
* 1-Click Install Wordpress
* Free SSL Certificate
* 24/7 Support

We use this service for both <a href="https://www.jcubhomefinder.com/">Production Site</a> and <a href="https://jcubhomefindercom.stage.site/">Staging Site</a> .

Even though it was not free but we manage to grab the domain name along with the hosting which is worth it.

# Version Control 

Version control of GitHub helps us practice of tracking, managing and comparing the old and the new version of the code that has been commited by each team member to the repository. However, in this assignment, we have not done version control in github until today. We use word document as a learning journal and updated website day by day. Therefore, on the last day of submission, we only have one day to gather all our learning journal to submit the complete file like this.

# Project Management
To facilitate our communication and task management, we have used Slack Channel, GitHub repository and Trello board.

* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PhucLanPhan/CMS-assignmen.git)<br/>
It was used to collaboratively work on the project and to keep track of the changes made by everyone to the project files.
* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/HfPsk2c6/cms)<br/>
It was used to ideate, plan, and manage the team work together in a collaborative, productive, and organized way.
* [Slack Channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T1HPNSNKT/C04QJQUABR6/thread/C04QJQUABR6-1682243806.851439)<br/>
We integrated the GitHub repository and Trello board with the Slack channel to get automatic notifications and updates in the Slack channel from the changes published in Trello board and GitHub repository so that every team member could see what everyone else in the team was working on.
