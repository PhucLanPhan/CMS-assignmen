# Version Control 

Version control of GitHub helps us practice of tracking, managing and comparing the old and the new version of the code that has been commited by each team member to the repository. However, in this assignment, we have not done version control in github until today. We use word document as a learning journal and updated website day by day. Therefore, on the last day of submission, we only have one day to gather all our learning journal to submit the complete file like this.

# Project Management
To facilitate our communication and task management, we have used Slack Channel, GitHub repository and Trello board.

* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PhucLanPhan/CMS-assignmen.git)<br/>
It was used to collaboratively work on the project and to keep track of the changes made by everyone to the project files.
* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/HfPsk2c6/cms)<br/>
It was used to ideate, plan, and manage the team work together in a collaborative, productive, and organized way.
* [Slack Channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T1HPNSNKT/C04QJQUABR6/thread/C04QJQUABR6-1682243806.851439)<br/>
We integrated the GitHub repository and Trello board with the Slack channel to get automatic notifications and updates in the Slack channel from the changes published in Trello board and GitHub repository so that every team member could see what everyone else in the team was working on.
